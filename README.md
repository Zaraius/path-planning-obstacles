To run our code simply download Path Planning with obstacle avoidance.mlappinstall, but the supporting code can be found in this repo too
Our final report can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15HrCOirV7N5bWt0yaJgDRiQNYiOsWJlDTVD2pA_Qi2c/edit?usp=sharing

Learning goal: 
At the end of this project, we will be able to effectively explain to another Oliner how gradient descent is applied in path generation by developing a model that generates a path using these concepts.

Overview of Project and Approach
We wanted to be able to create a path for a robot to follow from point A (green) to point B (red) with obstacles in the way (yellow circles). 
We chose to approach this by using gradient descent optimization, which allowed us to deepen our understanding of this concept through practical application.
